# unit_perf
It is a performance measurement tool as the perf supplement.

As we know, the perf is one good tool to find the performance bottleneck. But sometimes it is not good enough to profile our own codes especially the codes is only one part of whole system. In this case, we may don't care about the cost of the whole system. As a result, the unwanted results from other parts of system may occupies the most of top list, even we could not get the result we care really.  

You could specify the codes which you want to profile, maybe one function, even some linese of codes.  

And you could get the result by the proc
